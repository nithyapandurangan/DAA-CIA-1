For algorithms such as Prim's, Kruskal's and Dijkstra, we make use of the concept of data structure which is simpler to implement on C programming over
other programming languages.
For Prim's Algorithm- we make use of Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) data structure.
For Kruskal's Algorithm- we make use of graphs data strucure.
For Dijkstra's Algorithm - we make use of graphs data strucure as well.

Given we had learnt these data structures using C programming the last semester, I have used C programming.
