- The shortest path from source node to all possible nodes is possible to be found only using Dijkstra's Algorithm. Prim's and Kruskal's only give the 
shortest path between two random nodes and not for all possible nodes in a graph. 
- Dijkstra's Algorithm fails when a directed/undirected graph has negative edge weight. In presence of negative edge weights, Prim's and Kruskal's work
perfectly. 
- Prim's and Kruskal's usually do not work for directed graphs as it is possible for certain nodes to not have a path from it, which usually results in
an error in finding the shortest path. Whereas, Dijkstra's works for both directed and undirected graphs.
